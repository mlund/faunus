Welcome to Faunus
=================

Faunus is a C++ framework for Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of
molecular systems. Below is a brief overview of features:

- Canonical, Grand Canonical, Isobaric-Isothermal statistical mechanical ensembles
- General hamiltonian **parallel tempering** (temperature, screening length, bonds etc.)
- **Anisotropic** atoms (multipoles, sphero-cylinders, capped particles)
- Ion titration moves (pKa prediction, Hofmeister effects etc.)
- Highy modular
- Free and open source

Installing
===========

On mac or linux, install using [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html):

    $ conda install -c teokem faunus
