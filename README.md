Welcome to Faunus
=================

Faunus is a C++14 framework for Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of
molecular systems. Below is a brief overview of features:

- Canonical, Grand Canonical, Isobaric-Isothermal statistical mechanical ensembles
- General hamiltonian parallel tempering (temperature, screening length, bonds etc.)
- Anisotropic atoms (multipoles, sphero-cylinders, capped particles)
- Speciation moves (pKa prediction, Hofmeister effects, general equilibrium reactions etc.)
- Parallelise flat histogram method for sampling free energies along 1D/2D reaction coordinates
- Highy modular
- Free and open source

Installing
===========

On macOS or Linux, install using [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html):

    conda install -c conda-forge faunus

Or build from source, see [here](http://mlund.github.io/faunus/docs/install/).
