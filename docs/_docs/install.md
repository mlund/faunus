# Installing

## Using Conda

For macOS and Linux x86-64, precompiled binary packages are available
via [(mini)conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html):

~~~ bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install faunus
~~~

In addition to the `faunus` executable, this installs a set of examples in `share/faunus`,
as well as python bindings.
To _update_ an existing installation, use

~~~ bash
faunus --version      # show version string
conda search faunus   # show (new) revisions
conda upgrade faunus
~~~

For the adventurous, sporadically updated development versions can be installed with `conda install -c teokem faunus`. 
Starting from version 2.1, we adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## Building from source code

Faunus is continuously [tested](https://travis-ci.org/mlund/faunus) on macOS/Linux,
but should compile on most unix operating systems and possibly under Cygwin (Windows).

### Requirements

- CMake 3.16+
- C/C++17 compiler (Clang 5+, GCC 7+, etc.)
- Python 3.6+ with the following packages:
  - `jinja2`, `ruamel_yaml` or `yaml`

The following are optional:

- `jsonschema` (for validating input - highly recommended)
- `pandoc` (for building manual)
- `pypandoc` (for building manual)
- `BeautifulSoup4` (for building manual)
- Message Passing Interface (MPI)

**macOS tip:**
Apple's developer tools, Xcode, include clang;
CMake can be installed with an
[Installer package](https://cmake.org/download) from Kitware, or using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh), or
[(mini)conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)

### Compiling

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/mlund/faunus/releases/latest)
or [the developer branch](https://github.com/mlund/faunus/archive/master.zip)
and build using cmake:

~~~ bash
cd faunus
cmake . [OPTIONS]
make faunus
make usagetips # requires `pandoc`, `pypandoc`, `BeautifulSoup4`
~~~

Use `make help` to see all build targets.

The following options are available:

CMake Option                         | Description
------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------
`-DENABLE_MPI=OFF`                   | Enable MPI
`-DENABLE_OPENMP=ON`                 | Enable OpenMP support
`-DENABLE_TESTS=ON`                  | Enable unittesting
`-DENABLE_PYTHON=ON`                 | Build python bindings (experimental)
`-DENABLE_FREESASA=ON`               | Enable SASA routines (external download)
`-DENABLE_TBB=OFF`                   | Build with Intel Threading Building Blocks (experimental)
`-DBUILD_STATIC=OFF`                 | Build statically linked binaries
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`  | Alternatives: `Debug` or `Release` (faster, adventurous)
`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE="..."`    | Compiler options for Release mode
`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG="..."`      | Compiler options for Debug mode
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="..."`  | Install location (default: `/usr/local`)
`-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE="..."`          | Full path to Python executable
`-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR="..."`         | Full path to python headers
`-DPYTHON_LIBRARY="..."`             | Full path to python library, i.e. libpythonX.dylib/so


### Compiling the Manual

Pandoc is required to build the HTML manual: 

~~~ bash
make manual_html
~~~

In addition to pandoc, a TeX Live installation containing XeLaTeX is required to build the PDF manual.
The manual is supposed to be typeset with
[EB Garamond](https://github.com/octaviopardo/EBGaramond12/tree/master/fonts/otf),
[Garamond Math](https://github.com/YuanshengZhao/Garamond-Math/blob/master/Garamond-Math.otf) and
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/download/2/FiraCode_2.zip)
fonts thus they have to be available in your system. Alternatively, you can tweak the font options
in the `header.md` file.

~~~ bash
make manual
~~~

### Python libraries in odd locations

Should there be multiple compilers or python distributions, be specific:

~~~ bash
CC=/opt/bin/clang CXX=/opt/bin/clang++ cmake . \
  -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/bin/python3 \
  -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/include/python3.6 \
  -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/lib/libpython3.6.dylib
~~~

For solving python issues on macOS, the linked python library can be probed and,
if needed, renamed:

~~~ bash
otool -L pyfaunus.so
install_name_tool -change libpython3.6.dylib \
  $HOME/miniconda/lib/libpython3.6.dylib pyfaunus.so
~~~

### Resetting the build system

To change the compiler or for another reason reset the build system, do:

~~~ bash
make clean
rm -fR CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles _deps
~~~

# Development

The development of Faunus is done mainly in Jetbrain's [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion)
(free academic license) but any other IDE or merely a text editor can be used.
We do recommend to use tools that respect the provided `.clang-format` which will easy merging
changes into the code base, see below.

## Code Style

If you plan to contribute to Faunus it is recommended to activate the
pre-commit hook for automatic styling of all changes:

``` bash
cd faunus
./scripts/git-pre-commit-format install
```

This requires `clang-format` which may also be directly used in IDE's
such as CLion. In the top-level directory of Faunus you will find
the style configuration file [`.clang-format`](https://github.com/mlund/faunus/blob/master/.clang-format)

Also, adhere to the following naming conventions:

Style        | Elements
------------ | -------------------------
`PascalCase` | classes, namespaces
`camelCase`  | functions
`snake_case` | variables


## Creating a conda package (development usage)

The basic steps for creating a conda package is outlined below, albeit
details depend on the build environment. See also the `.travis.yml`
configuration file in the main repository.

~~~ bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install conda-build anaconda-client
cd scripts/
conda-build .
anaconda login
anaconda upload -u USER ... # see output from build step
~~~

Instead of uploading to anaconda.org, install a local copy directly after the build step above:

~~~ bash
conda install -c USER faunus --use-local
~~~
