# This is an energy calculation of a fixed configuration of a mixture
# of patchy sphero-cylinders. The PSC code has been ported from Faunus V1
# where we got a an energy of -308.884 kT:

# Note that running in RELEASE mode with aggressive optimizations, the
# total energy may deviate by a few percent.
