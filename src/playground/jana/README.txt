This will simulate a number of rigid proteins confined
to a plane. The proteins are subject to proton fluctuations
as well as an Gouy-Chapman electric potential.

 FILES
~~~~~~~

wall.cpp:
  Main C++ program.

jana-wall:
  Executable generated by running

  $ make jana-wall

  from the top faunus directory.

wall.run:
  Run-script that will generate all input
  files and run the executable. This is the
  file you want to modify!

wall.json: (generated by wall.run)
  Input file with atomic properties

wall.input: (generated by wall.run)
  General input file to controll MC simulation

testmolecule.aam: (generated by wall.run)
  A small two-atom test molecule

state:
  After each simulation coordinates etc. are
  saved in this file. If this file exists when
  starting a new run, the state will be loaded
  to continue the run. Therefore, whenever new
  parameters are being used, delete this file
  first!

confout.pqr + traj.xtc:
  PDB-like snapshot and trajectory that can be opened in VMD,

  $ vmd confout.pqr traj.xtc
  $ pbc box

traj.xtc:
  Gromacs trajectory file that can be opened in VMD
  together with confout.pqr
